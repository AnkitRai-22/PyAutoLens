LENS + SOURCE
-------------

For a simple lens-source system, the ray tracing is as follows:

            / \
           /   \
          /     \
         /       \
        /         \
       /           \
Earth  --- Lens1 --- Source
       \           /
        \         /
         \       /
          \     /
           \   /
            \ /

So, to perform ray-tracing, we:

1) Compute deflection angles at Lens1 (the image-plane).
2) Trace image-plane coordinates to source-plane.

LENS + LENS + SOURCE
--------------------

For a lens-lens-source system, the ray tracing is as follows:

                / \
               /   \
            --      \
           /         \
          /           \
         /             \
Earth-Lens1-Lens2----- Source
         \             /
          \           /
           \         /
            --      /
               \   /
                \ /

So, to perform ray-tracing, we:

1) Compute deflection angles at Lens1 (the image-plane)
2) Trace to Lens2's lens-plane, by using the deflection angles scaled by the ratio of angular diameter distances, Beta.
3) Compute deflection angles at Lens2, using Lens2's lens-plane coordinates.
4) Trace to Source's plane, using each set of deflection angles scaled by new values of Beta to reflect the new redshifts
of the tracing.

MULTIPLE PLANES
---------------

Following LENS+LENS+SOURCE above, we go to each lens, compute its deflection angles at its lens-plane coordinates
and then use them with the scale factor beta to trace them to the next source-plane. We compute the deflection angles at
each set of source-plane coordinates and scale by redshift as appropriate.
