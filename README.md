# AutoLens
AutoLens - Automated Modeling of Strong Gravitational Lens Systems

This python project will develop the AutoLens method (links below) in python, with a long-term view to make the lens modeling software open-source and available for the community. AutoLens, in its current form, is a large Fortran library of code, which this project will convert into a set of modules for performing fast lens analysis calculations.

This is a long-term project and I don't have huge amounts of time to work on this currently, so this may well take over a year or two! However, I hope to work on it when I have time, and a number of routines I need more for immediate for data handling / visualization problems will be coded up in the short-term and available here.

if You'd like to contribute, feel free to contact me!
