PyAutoLens - Strong Lens Modeling for the Masses

Welcome to PyAutoLens! A project aiming to make strong gravitational lens modeling openly available to the astronomy community. The project is open-source and comes packaged as a set of easy-to-use Python modules. 

PyAutoLens is based on the two methods below, but will ultimately go way beyond what they achieved:

https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07377

PyAutoLens is still in development and not yet at version 1.0. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend anyone tries to model any lenses using it without consulting me first.

if You'd like to contribute, feel free to contact me!
